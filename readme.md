A one-day service hackathon with the Girl Scouts of Utah (supported by Hack Club HQ) to share our love for making things and make coding feel more accessible, especially for underrepresented groups in tech. This is following the huge success we saw with Horizon! And outside of the hackathon, we're having a dinner the night before with some inspiring tech leaders based in Utah.
