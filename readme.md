Following the huge success of [Horizon](https://horizon.hackclub.com), we decided to bring the amazing experience we developed in New York City to the heart of Utah. Alpine was a one-day service hackathon with the Girl Scouts of Utah (supported by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)) to share our love for making things and make coding feel more accessible, especially for underrepresented groups in tech. Before the event, we had a dinner with inspiring women in technology based in Utah.
